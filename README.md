Usefull shell stripts 

Unix and especially Linux is a really fine operating system. 
For almost al problems You can find a solution in the software repositories
of the distributor. If You get not satisfied with the provided solution 
it might have one of the following reasons: 
 * You are not really clear of what You want or need
   --> Go meditate your situation and needs until its clear what You are 
   really looking for
 * You have something in mind  which is almost orthgonal or cross to a 
   technical sollution (maybe due to you ar not familiar with coding).
   --> Go open Your minde/view to find an other route to the top of the hill. 
 * You do not know the name of the solving software solution You are looking 
   for, thus You cannot install it. 
   --> Go ask the community (an other way with other Words and different view)
 * It is really something You want that is not already there - or by any 
   mysterious reason You really can not find or do not want to use it.
   this includes technical reasons as well as political, religious, ethical or 
   esthetic motivations.  
   --> Go use the construction kit your Unix (e.g. Linux) provides and 
   screw together what ever it takes to solve exactly Your problem.
The last point is where the well known Unix tools comes into play.

This repository holds some shell scripts that helps at least on my site to get  
done what is of need. 
Most probably rather less of this little 'tools' fit exactly Your need, 
however Yo can tune it quit easily to do what You need on Your site. 

If You have the impression Your modification or tuning might be of a broader 
Interest feel free to come up with updates. 

Sincerely 

Mat
